## :bulb: Curiosities about me

- I started web developing when I was 10 years old, creating some landing pages and **coding for fun**.
- As the years passed, I noticed how powerful technology can be when it comes to changing lives. Thus, I began to apply my knowledge to create truly **meaningful impacts in my communities**.
- As part of my journey, I also acquired some knowledge in UI/UX design through which I try to always bring **the best experience for every user**.
- I'm always up for interdisciplinary projects, trying to make software engineering more than just coding, but **an opportunity to explore different fields**.
